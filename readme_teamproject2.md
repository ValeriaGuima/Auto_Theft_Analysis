# Auto Theft Incident Analysis-Hui Li's work

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing auto theft incidents in Toronto to help the Toronto Police Services allocate resources more effectively. The goal was to identify the times of day when auto thefts are most likely to occur using historical data.

## My Contributions

- **Data Analysis**: I worked on cleaning and grouping the data by the hour of the day to prepare it for analysis.
- **Polynomial Regression**: I implemented polynomial regression to model the relationship between the hour of the day and the number of incidents.
- **Visualization**: I created visualizations to compare the actual incident counts with the model's predictions.

### Key Visualization

One of the main visualizations from this project is the polynomial regression curve, which shows the number of incidents across different hours of the day:

In the plot:
- **Blue dots** represent actual incident data.
- **Red curve** shows the polynomial regression fit.

This visualization helps identify peak hours for auto theft, which is crucial for resource planning.

## Teamwork and Assistance

This project was a team effort. I took the lead on the regression analysis and visualization. My team and I worked together to ensure the analysis was accurate and insightful.

### Role of ChatGPT

ChatGPT assisted me by:
- Helping select and implement the best regression model.
- Offering tips on improving visualizations.
- Resolving coding issues during the project.

The guidance provided by ChatGPT helped streamline the process and improve the quality of the final analysis.

## Conclusion

The analysis provides actionable insights into when auto thefts are most likely to occur, helping the Toronto Police Services allocate their resources more effectively during peak hours.
